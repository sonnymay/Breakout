# Breakout

Breakout is a classic arcade game where the player must use a paddle to bounce a ball and break through a wall of bricks. This web version of Breakout was created using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

Getting Started

You can play the Breakout game by visiting the GitHub Pages website. Alternatively, you can clone the repository to your local machine and run the game locally. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/sonnymay/Breakout.git.
2. Navigate to the project directory using cd Breakout.
3. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

How to Play

Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the paddle and bounce the ball. The objective is to break through all the bricks without letting the ball fall off the bottom of the screen. You have 3 lives to start with, and each time you miss the ball you lose a life. You can earn extra points by hitting power-up items that occasionally appear.
